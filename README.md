# ctesiphon
15-112 Final Project

# Overview
Ctesiphon will is a *sandbox civilization simulator* on a procedurally-generated world. In particular, it will be a mostly hands-off experience focusing on the interactions and evolution of civilizations and cultures over time. Players will be able to view the simulation as it evolves over time, as well as slightly influencing events through various means.

# How to Run
Execute init.py, and the game will run. No libraries need to be installed.

# Shortcut Commands
Press 'f' or 'h' to spawn a fire / hurricane on the currently selected city. While not truly shortcuts, you can press space to pause, and escape to bring up the escape menu to save or return to the start screen.
